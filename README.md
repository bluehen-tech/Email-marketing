# Email Mass Sender – Proof of Concept

A lightweight, cross-platform Python script for sending personalized emails to multiple recipients using Gmail’s SMTP service.  
This project demonstrates a simple, flexible architecture for small-scale marketing, notifications, or newsletter systems.

## Project Structure

```

marketing_email/
│
├── send_mail_poc.py        # Main Python script
│
├── app_pw.txt              # (Optional) stores Gmail App Password securely
│
└── mailing_list/           # Email content and recipient data
├── emails.csv          # Recipient list (name,email)
├── subject.txt         # Email subject line
└── body.txt            # Email body text (supports {name} placeholder)

## Requirements

- Python **3.8+**
- Gmail account with **2-Step Verification** enabled
- A **16-character App Password** generated at  
  [https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords)
- Internet access (for SMTP)

_No third-party packages needed – only Python’s standard library._

---

## How It Works

1. **Prompts for user credentials**  
   You enter your Gmail address and App Password (never stored).
2. **Reads message content**  
   From `emails.csv`, `subject.txt`, and `body.txt`.
3. **Builds and sends personalized emails**  
   Each recipient gets an individual email using `{name}` substitution.
4. **Includes 1-second delay**  
   To lower spam-flag risk.

## Usage

### 1 Prepare your files
Example **emails.csv**:
```csv
name,email
Julie Nguyen,julng@udel.edu
Ekaterina Bergwell,ebergwal@udel.edu
Tejas Pawar,tejasp@udel.edu
````

Example **subject.txt**:

```
✨ Welcome to the DSSA Newsletter
```

Example **body.txt**:

```
Hey {name} 👋,

This is a test email sent automatically using Python.
If you received this, our proof of concept works perfectly 🚀

Warm regards,
Tunmbi
```

### 2 Run the script

```bash
python send_mail_poc.py
```

### 3 Follow prompts

```
Email Mass Sender - Proof of Concept
Enter your email address: your_email@gmail.com
Enter your 16-character App Password:
```

Each recipient will then receive a personalized copy.

## Security Notes

* **Never** use your regular Gmail password.
  Always use the 16-character **App Password** generated by Google.
* The script **does not** store credentials.
* If you use `app_pw.txt`, make sure it’s **excluded from any public repo**.

---

## Personalization

Use `{name}` inside `body.txt` to dynamically insert each recipient’s name.

Example:

```
Hi {name},

We’re glad to have you on board.
```

➡ becomes

```
Hi Leke,
```
